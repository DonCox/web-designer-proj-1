# Project 1
### Roon blog clone

Wednesday class has decided on a design mockup to recreate for our next project. The goal was to pick a clean, simple layout with the intention of replicating it as closely as possible, building it to be responsive. We decided on a blog article design by Drew Wilson.

**Goal**

Ideally we'll only spend a couple weeks on this project, allowing time for a final project that will be a bit more involved. Feel free to add any questions/suggestions on the GitHub wiki for this project.

## How's this work?

1. Fork this project via GitHub.
2. Build your project out.
3. Push your project up to **your GitHub account**. All of your personal projects will live on repos of your personal account.
4. If you notice any issues or would like to contribute to the project, create pull requests via GitHub.
5. To sync your fork to the original project (upstream): https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork
6. This is a process. Any feedback is welcome.

**Tips**

- Set your body background image to the design mockup you downloaded. This will help ensure your work matches the designer's as closely as possible.
- Don't worry about customizing anything just yet. We may get to that later, or we may not.
- By our next meetup, I will make assets available (images, icons, fonts, etc.). Until then, just use your own as placeholders.
- Pay close attention to typography and spacing. These things make or break designs, especially one as restrained as this.
- A great lightweight grid framework you might look into using is Skeleton, although there are many others. Alternatively, you could roll your own.
