### Project 1


Wednesday class has decided on a design mockup to recreate for our next project. The goal was to pick a clean, simple layout with the intention of replicating it as closely as possible, building it to be responsive. We decided on a blog article design by Drew Wilson.

**Info**
Ideally we'll only spend a couple weeks on this project, allowing time for a final project that will be a bit more involved. Feel free to contact me at erow80@gmail.com if you are interested in participating or have any questions/suggestions.

**Tips**
- Set your body background image to the design mockup you downloaded. This will help ensure your work matches the designer's as closely as possible.
- Don't worry about customizing anything just yet. We may get to that later, or we may not.
- By our next meetup, I will make assets available (images, icons, fonts, etc.). Until then, just use your own as placeholders.
- Pay close attention to typography and spacing. These things make or break designs, especially one as restrained as this.
- A great lightweight grid framework you might look into using is Skeleton, although there are many others. Alternatively, you could roll your own.
